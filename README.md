# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to put together
a systematically reproducible version of all
sites &amp; projects related to [my site](https://robert-novak.com)
using vagrant and ansible. This should hopefully
make moving between providers easier and less of a hassle.

## Development
Working with this project requires the installation
of several key components, namely `ansible` and 
`vagrant`. So far the development work has taken
place primarily using [Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox)
as the VM provider.
